### From Blogger

Migrated from Blogger with a field on new posts of "Previous Blogger URL"
so that we can more easily redirect.

### Posts

Posts are structred under `content/posts/`.
They have the directory named after the blog entry title.

Inside is the core markdown (index.md) and optionally the images
used in the blog entry.

### Authors

Authors are configured via `content/authors/`.
