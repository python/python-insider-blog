It's with a note of sadness that I announce the final retirement of Python 3.4. The final release was back in March, but I didn't get around to actually closing and deleting the 3.4 branch until this morning. Python 3.4 introduced many features we all enjoy in modern Python--the asyncio, ensurepip, and enum packages, just to name three. It's a release I hope we all remember fondly.  
My eternal thanks to all the members of the release team that worked on Python 3.4:  

> Georg Brandl  
> Julien Palard Martin von Löwis Ned Deily  
> Steve Dower  
> Terry Reedy and all the engineers of the Python infrastructure team.

Special thanks to Benjamin Peterson and Ned Deily, who frequently scurried around behind the scenes cleaning up the messes I cluelessly left in my wake.  
Having closed 3.4, I am now retired as Python 3.4 Release Manager. I regret to inform all of you that you're still stuck with me as Python 3.5 Release Manager until sometime next year.
