It's time for another set of Python releases! **Python 3.11.3, 3.10.11 and 3.12 alpha 7 are now available.**

### Python 3.12.0 alpha 7

The final alpha release of Python 3.12! The next release will be beta 1, which is also the feature freeze. Last chance to get your new features and API changes into 3.12!

*246 new commits since 3.12.0a6.*

### Python 3.11.3

More bugfixes and security fixes for the best Python version (so far).

*167 new commits since 3.11.2*

### Python 3.10.11

The final regular bugfix release for Python 3.10! It is now entering security-fix-only mode. This also means this is the last version for which we will ship Windows and macOS installers. **If you rely on these binary releases, it's time to upgrade to Python 3.11.**

*121 new commits since 3.10.10.*
