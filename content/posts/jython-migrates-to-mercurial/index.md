Jython has finally migrated from Subversion to Mercurial. This has been a long time coming: unfortunately we had a difficult Subversion repo that took some effort to cleanly convert to a different revision control system.

The new official Jython repo is now hosted @

[http://hg.python.org/jython](http://hg.python.org/jython)

with a [BitBucket Mirror](http://bitbucket.org/jython/jython) for easy forking.

There's also a larger read-only repo with ongoing feature branches (converted to Mercurial Bookmarks) hosted at [http://hg.python.org/jython-fullhistory](http://hg.python.org/jython-fullhistory)

Mercurial makes it even easier to contribute to Jython, pull up a fork and come help us build Jython 2.6!
