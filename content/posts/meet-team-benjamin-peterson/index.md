**How long have you been using Python?**

3.5 years.

**How long have you been a core committer?**

Exactly 3 years this March 25th.

**How did you get started as a core developer? Do you remember your first commit?**

My first proposal was personally [rejected by Guido himself](http://bugs.python.org/issue1828). Luckily, I persisted and got some patches accepted. I believe my first commit was reordering the Misc/ACKS file.

**Which parts of Python are you working on now?**

I like the parser, compiler, and interpreter core, but I've been known to dabble in just about every part of core Python development... except Windows!

**What do you do with Python when you aren't doing core development work?**

I use it to implement a Python interpreter ([http://pypy.org](http://pypy.org/))! Truly, I'm a Python implementor at heart. :) I am the creator of six ([http://pypi.python.org/pypi/six](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/six)), a Python 2 and 3 compatibility library.

**What do you do when you aren't programming?**

Compose music, play clarinet, and read math books. I do a little hiking now and then, too.
