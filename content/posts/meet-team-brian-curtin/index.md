**How long have you been using Python?**

On a day to day basis going on 6 years. Prior to that I used it occasionally for a class in college and also at a summer internship.

**How long have you been a core committer?**

Just over a year. March 24 marked my first year with the group.

**How did you get started as a core developer? Do you remember your first commit?**

I got started after noticing a documentation bug while writing an extension module at work, then I submitted a simple patch and Georg Brandl committed it almost immediately. After having that quick success and a fresh source checkout, I wanted to dive in and learn more about the modules I was using and ended up writing a patch to add context manager support to zipfile.

The first few commits I made were documentation fixes in order to keep it simple early on. My first code commit was to add a few features and expand test coverage in the winreg module.

**Which parts of Python are you working on now?**

As one of the few Windows users involved in CPython development, I try to keep an eye on whatever issues Windows users are having. Due to that, I've had a chance to work on a bunch of the standard library, including modules I hadn't used. I haven't done much with the interpreter itself, but I'm looking to change that.

**What do you do with Python when you aren't doing core development work?**

I build a variety of test tools for a trading database which is written in C++. There's an extension module for the data API so we can easily write regression tests, performance tests, and we're always trying to build more.

**What do you do when you aren't programming?**

I'm a huge baseball fan. I umpire college baseball in the spring, various leagues in the summer, and mix in watching and going to Chicago Cubs games.
