**How long have you been using Python?**

Around ten years

**How long have you been a core committer?**

Since December 21 2008

**How did you get started as a core developer? Do you remember your first commit?**

I started as a core developer in order to maintain Distutils and make it evolve.

My first commit as a core developer was a fix for small bug in a distutils feature I proposed before I became a committer. That feature was added the week before in Python. It's the ability to configure Distutils' register and upload commands to work with several pypi-like servers.

I committed with my brand new rights on Wed, 24 Dec 2008, which happens to be my birthday, and also the 17th anniversary of the 0.9.4 release of Python.

**Which parts of Python are you working on now?**

In the stdlib: sysconfig, distutils, packaging (to be added in 3.3), shutil, pkgutil, and occasionally in other modules

**What do you do with Python when you aren't doing core development work?**

I work at Mozilla in the Service team, where I build web services using Python

**What do you do when you aren't programming?**

I read comics/graphic novels, write books, play with my kids, drink wines with my wife, and try to renovate my 1848's house.
