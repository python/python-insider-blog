If you read [Python Insider](http://blog.python.org) through a feed reader, you may not have seen the new page design [Marcin Wojtczuk](http://twitter.com/sigviper) created for us. It looks great while maintaining a lightweight feel, and we couldn't be happier with the results.

Thank you for your time and efforts, Marcin!
