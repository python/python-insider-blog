New PyPI launched, legacy PyPI shutting down April 30 Starting today, the canonical Python Package Index is at https://pypi.org and uses the new Warehouse codebase. We announced the https://pypi.org beta on March 26 and your feedback and test usage have helped us get it production-ready. Monday April 16 (2018-04-16): We launched the new PyPI, redirecting browser traffic and API calls (including "pip install") from pypi.python.org to the new site. The old codebase is still available at https://legacy.pypi.org for now. Monday April 30 (2018-04-30): We plan to shut down legacy PyPI https://legacy.pypi.org . The address pypi.python.org will continue to redirect to Warehouse. For more details, see our roadmap: https://wiki.python.org/psf/WarehouseRoadmap If your site/service links to or uses pypi.python.org, you should start using pypi.org instead: https://warehouse.readthedocs.io/api-reference/integration-guide/#migrating-to-the-new-pypi Thank you. -Sumana Harihareswara on behalf of the PyPI Team
