The Python Insider [translation project](http://blog.python.org/2011/05/python-insider-translation-project.html) is continuing to grow! Today we are launching [Portuguese](http://blog-pt.python.org), [German](http://blog-de.python.org), [Korean](http://blog-ko.python.org), and [Traditional Chinese](http://blog-tw.python.org) versions of the blog. The translators have already started publishing the backlog of posts. As with the other translations, these parallel editions may lag slightly behind the original posts on [Python Insider](http://blog.python.org/).
