Python **[3.7.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)** is now available (and so is [3.6.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366/))! On behalf of the Python development community and the Python 3.7 release team, we are pleased to announce the availability of **Python 3.7.0**. Python 3.7.0 is the newest feature release of the Python language, and it contains many new features and optimizations. You can find Python 3.7.0 here: [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) Most third-party distributors of Python should be making 3.7.0 packages available soon. See the [What’s New In Python 3.7](https://docs.python.org/3.7/whatsnew/3.7.html) document for more information about features included in the 3.7 series. Detailed information about the changes made in 3.7.0 can be found in its [change log](https://docs.python.org/3.7/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-7-0-final). Maintenance releases for the 3.7 series will follow at regular intervals starting in July of 2018. We hope you enjoy Python 3.7! P.S. We are also happy to announce the availability of **Python 3.6.6**, the next maintenance release of Python 3.6: [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366/) Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development and these releases possible! Please consider supporting our efforts by volunteering yourself or through organization contributions to the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/).
