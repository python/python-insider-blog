Remember us? It’s your friendly CPython release team and we have something we think you may like: The new alpha release of Python 3.10 is here, now with 100% more pattern matching. If I were you, I would download it and start playing with it. Extra points if you report us any bugs you find along the way! Are you confused about all this pattern matching business? Fear not, this release also includes some fantastic documentation and some shiny new “What’s new” entries.

Check them here and tell us how we can improve it:

This is an early developer preview of Python 3.10

# Major new features of the 3.10 series, compared to 3.9

Python 3.10 is still in development. This release, 3.10.0a6 is the sixth of seven planned alpha releases.  
Alpha releases are intended to make it easier to test the current state of new features and bug fixes and to test the release process.  
During the alpha phase, features may be added up until the start of the beta phase (2021-05-03) and, if necessary, may be modified or deleted up until the release candidate phase (2021-10-04). Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for production environments.

Many new features for Python 3.10 are still being planned and written. Among the new major  
new features and changes so far:

-   [PEP 623](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0623/) – Remove wstr from Unicode
    
-   [PEP 604](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0604/) – Allow writing union types as X | Y
    
-   [PEP 612](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0612/) – Parameter Specification Variables
    
-   [PEP 626](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0626/) – Precise line numbers for debugging and other tools.
    
-   [bpo-38605](https://bugs.python.org/issue38605): `from __future__ import annotations` ([PEP 563](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/)) is now the default.
    
-   [PEP 618](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0618/) – Add Optional Length-Checking To zip.
    
-   [bpo-12782](https://bugs.python.org/issue12782): Parenthesized context managers are now officially allowed.
    
-   [PEP 632](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0632/) – Deprecate distutils module.
    
-   [PEP 613](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0613/) – Explicit Type Aliases
    
-   [PEP 634](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/) – Structural Pattern Matching: Specification
    
-   [PEP 635](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0635/) – Structural Pattern Matching: Motivation and Rationale
    
-   [PEP 636](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0636/) – Structural Pattern Matching: Tutorial
    
-   (Hey, fellow core developer, if a feature you find important is missing from this list, [let Pablo know](mailto:pablogsal@python.org).)
    

The next pre-release of Python 3.10 will be 3.10.0a7 ( last alpha release), currently scheduled for Monday, 2021-04-05.

# And now for something completely different

Schwarzschild wormholes, also known as Einstein–Rosen bridges (named after Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen), are connections between areas of space that can be modelled as vacuum solutions to the Einstein field equations, and that are now understood to be intrinsic parts of the maximally extended version of the Schwarzschild metric describing an eternal black hole with no charge and no rotation. Here, “maximally extended” refers to the idea that the spacetime should not have any “edges”: it should be possible to continue this path arbitrarily far into the particle’s future or past for any possible trajectory of a free-falling particle (following a geodesic in the spacetime).

Although Schwarzschild wormholes are not traversable in both directions, their existence inspired Kip Thorne to imagine traversable wormholes created by holding the “throat” of a Schwarzschild wormhole open with exotic matter (material that has negative mass/energy).
