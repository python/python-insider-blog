## [](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3106/)

## This is the sixth maintenance release of Python 3.10

Python 3.10.6 is the newest major release of the Python programming language, and it contains many new features and optimizations.

## Major new features of the 3.10 series, compared to 3.9

Among the new major new features and changes so far:

-   [PEP 604](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0604/) – Allow writing union types as X | Y

-   [PEP 612](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0612/) – Parameter Specification Variables

-   [PEP 626](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0626/) – Precise line numbers for debugging and other tools.

-   [PEP 618](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0618/) – Add Optional Length-Checking To zip.

-   [bpo-12782](https://bugs.python.org/issue12782): Parenthesized context managers are now officially allowed.

-   [PEP 632](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0632/) – Deprecate distutils module.

-   [PEP 613](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0613/) – Explicit Type Aliases

-   [PEP 634](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/) – Structural Pattern Matching: Specification

-   [PEP 635](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0635/) – Structural Pattern Matching: Motivation and Rationale

-   [PEP 636](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0636/) – Structural Pattern Matching: Tutorial

-   [PEP 644](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0644/) – Require OpenSSL 1.1.1 or newer

-   [PEP 624](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0624/) – Remove Py\_UNICODE encoder APIs

[bpo-38605](https://bugs.python.org/issue38605): `from __future__ import annotations` ([PEP 563](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/)) used to be on this list in previous pre-releases but it has been postponed to Python 3.11 due to some compatibility concerns.

## And now for something completely different

A pentaquark is a human-made subatomic particle, consisting of four quarks and one antiquark bound together; they are not known to occur naturally or exist outside of experiments to create them. As quarks have a baryon number of (+1/3), and antiquarks of (−1/3), the pentaquark would have a total baryon number of 1 and thus would be a baryon. Further, because it has five quarks instead of the usual three found in regular baryons (a.k.a. ‘triquarks’), it is classified as an exotic baryon. The name pentaquark was coined by Claude Gignoux et al. (1987) and Harry J. Lipkin in 1987; however, the possibility of five-quark particles was identified as early as 1964 when Murray Gell-Mann first postulated the existence of quarks. Although predicted for decades, pentaquarks proved surprisingly tricky to discover and some physicists were beginning to suspect that an unknown law of nature prevented their production.
