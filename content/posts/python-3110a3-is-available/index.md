You can tell that we are slowly getting closer to the first beta as the number of release blockers that we need to fix on every release starts to increase ![:sweat_smile:](./image-1.png) But we did it!

## Major new features of the 3.11 series, compared to 3.10

Among the new major new features and changes so far:  

-   [PEP 657](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0657/) – Include Fine-Grained Error Locations in Tracebacks
-   [PEP 654](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0654/) – PEP 654 – Exception Groups and except\*  
    

-   The [Faster Cpython Project](https://github.com/faster-cpython) is already yielding some exciting results: this version of CPython 3.11 is ~19% faster on the geometric mean of the [performance benchmarks](http://speed.python.org), compared to 3.10.0.
(Hey, fellow core developer, if a feature you find important is missing from this list, [let Pablo know](mailto:pablogsal@python.org).)

The next pre-release of Python 3.11 will be 3.11.0a3, currently scheduled for 2022-01-03.

## And now for something completely different

Rayleigh scattering, named after the nineteenth-century British physicist Lord Rayleigh is the predominantly elastic scattering of light or other electromagnetic radiation by particles much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. For light frequencies well below the resonance frequency of the scattering particle, the amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. Rayleigh scattering results from the electric polarizability of the particles. The oscillating electric field of a light wave acts on the charges within a particle, causing them to move at the same frequency. The particle, therefore, becomes a small radiating dipole whose radiation we see as scattered light. The particles may be individual atoms or molecules; it can occur when light travels through transparent solids and liquids but is most prominently seen in gases.

The strong wavelength dependence of the scattering means that shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered more strongly than longer (red) wavelengths. This results in the indirect blue light coming from all regions of the sky.

## We hope you enjoy the new releases!
