We needed to tame some angry buildbots, but after a small fight, we won with just some scratches! Here you have a shiny new alpha release: Python 3.11.0a5.

## Major new features of the 3.11 series, compared to 3.10

Among the new major new features and changes so far:  

-   [PEP 657](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0657/) – Include Fine-Grained Error Locations in Tracebacks
-   [PEP 654](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0654/) – Exception Groups and except\*
-   [PEP 673](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0673/) – Self Type
-   [PEP 646](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0646/) – Variadic Generics
-   The [Faster Cpython Project](https://github.com/faster-cpython) is already yielding some exciting results: this version of CPython 3.11 is ~19% faster on the geometric mean of the [performance benchmarks](http://speed.python.org), compared to 3.10.0.
(Hey, fellow core developer, if a feature you find important is missing from this list, [let Pablo know](mailto:pablogsal@python.org).)

The next pre-release of Python 3.11 will be 3.11.0a6, currently scheduled for Monday, 2022-02-28.

## And now for something completely different

In physics, the Poynting vector (Umov-Poynting vector) represents the directional energy flux (the energy transfer per unit area per unit time) or power flow of an electromagnetic field. It is named after its discoverer John Henry Poynting who first derived it in 1884. Oliver Heaviside also discovered it independently in the more general form that recognises the freedom of adding the curl of an arbitrary vector field to the definition. The Poynting vector is used throughout electromagnetics in conjunction with Poynting's theorem, the continuity equation expressing conservation of electromagnetic energy, to calculate the power flow in electromagnetic fields.

## We hope you enjoy the new releases!
