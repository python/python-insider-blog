There are no easy releases these days! :sweat: After a week of delay due to several release blockers, buildbot problems and pandemic-related difficulties here is 3.11.0a6 for you to test.

## Major new features of the 3.11 series, compared to 3.10

Among the new major new features and changes so far:  

-   [PEP 657](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0657/) – Include Fine-Grained Error Locations in Tracebacks
-   [PEP 654](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0654/) – Exception Groups and except\*
-   [PEP 673](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0673/) – Self Type
-   [PEP 646](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0646/) – Variadic Generics
-   The [Faster Cpython Project](https://github.com/faster-cpython) is already yielding some exciting results: this version of CPython 3.11 is ~19% faster on the geometric mean of the [performance benchmarks](http://speed.python.org), compared to 3.10.0.
(Hey, fellow core developer, if a feature you find important is missing from this list, [let Pablo know](mailto:pablogsal@python.org).)

The next pre-release of Python 3.11 will be 3.11.0a7, currently scheduled for Tuesday, 2022-04-05.

## And now for something completely different

In astrophysics and nuclear physics, nuclear pasta is a theoretical type of degenerate matter that is postulated to exist within the crusts of neutron stars. If it does in fact exist, nuclear pasta is the strongest material in the universe. Between the surface of a neutron star and the quark-gluon plasma at the core, at matter densities of 1014 g/cm3, nuclear attraction and Coulomb repulsion forces are of similar magnitude. The competition between the forces leads to the formation of a variety of complex structures assembled from neutrons and protons. Astrophysicists call these types of structures nuclear pasta because the geometry of the structures resembles various types of pasta.

There are several phases of evolution (I swear these names are real), including the gnocchi phase, the spaghetti phase, the lasagna phase, the bucatini phase and the Swiss cheese phase.

## We hope you enjoy the new releases!
