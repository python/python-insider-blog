## This is the sixth maintenance release of Python 3.11

Python 3.11.6 is the newest major release of the Python programming language, and it contains many new features and optimizations. Get it here:

[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3116/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3116/)

## Major new features of the 3.11 series, compared to 3.10

Among the new major new features and changes so far:  

-   [PEP 657](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0657/) – Include Fine-Grained Error Locations in Tracebacks
-   [PEP 654](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0654/) – Exception Groups and except\*
-   [PEP 673](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0673/) – Self Type
-   [PEP 646](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0646/) – Variadic Generics
-   [PEP 680](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0680/) – tomllib: Support for Parsing TOML in the Standard Library
-   [PEP 675](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0675/) – Arbitrary Literal String Type
-   [PEP 655](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0655/) – Marking individual TypedDict items as required or potentially-missing
-   [bpo-46752](https://bugs.python.org/issue46752) – Introduce task groups to asyncio
-   [PEP 681](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0681/) – Data Class Transforms
-   [bpo-433030](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/34627/)– Atomic grouping ((?>…)) and possessive quantifiers (`*+, ++, ?+, {m,n}+`) are now supported in regular expressions.
-   The [Faster Cpython Project](https://github.com/faster-cpython) is already yielding some exciting results. Python 3.11 is up to 10-60% faster than Python 3.10. On average, we measured a 1.22x speedup on the standard benchmark suite. See [Faster CPython for details.](https://docs.python.org/3.11/whatsnew/3.11.html#faster-cpython)

## And now for something completely different

A g-factor (also called g value) is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the magnetic moment and angular momentum of an atom, a particle or the nucleus. It is essentially a proportionality constant that relates the different observed magnetic moments μ of a particle to their angular momentum quantum numbers and a unit of magnetic moment (to make it dimensionless), usually the Bohr magneton or nuclear magneton. Its value is proportional to the gyromagnetic ratio.

## We hope you enjoy the new releases!
