![:warning:](./image-2.png) This is the last bug fix release of Python 3.11 ![:warning:](./image-3.png)

## This is the ninth maintenance release of Python 3.11

Python 3.11.9 is the newest major release of the Python programming language, and it contains many new features and optimizations. Get it here:

[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/)

## Major new features of the 3.11 series, compared to 3.10

Among the new major new features and changes so far:  

-   [PEP 657](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0657/) – Include Fine-Grained Error Locations in Tracebacks
-   [PEP 654](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0654/) – Exception Groups and except\*
-   [PEP 673](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0673/) – Self Type
-   [PEP 646](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0646/) – Variadic Generics
-   [PEP 680](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0680/) – tomllib: Support for Parsing TOML in the Standard Library
-   [PEP 675](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0675/) – Arbitrary Literal String Type
-   [PEP 655](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0655/) – Marking individual TypedDict items as required or potentially-missing
-   [bpo-46752](https://bugs.python.org/issue46752) – Introduce task groups to asyncio
-   [PEP 681](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0681/) – Data Class Transforms
-   [bpo-433030](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/34627/)– Atomic grouping ((?>…)) and possessive quantifiers (`*+, ++, ?+, {m,n}+`) are now supported in regular expressions.
-   The [Faster Cpython Project](https://github.com/faster-cpython) is already yielding some exciting results. Python 3.11 is up to 10-60% faster than Python 3.10. On average, we measured a 1.22x speedup on the standard benchmark suite. See [Faster CPython for details.](https://docs.python.org/3.11/whatsnew/3.11.html#faster-cpython)

## And now for something completely different

A kugelblitz is a theoretical astrophysical object predicted by general relativity. It is a concentration of heat, light or radiation so intense that its energy forms an event horizon and becomes self-trapped. In other words, if enough radiation is aimed into a region of space, the concentration of energy can warp spacetime so much that it creates a black hole. This would be a black hole whose original mass–energy was in the form of radiant energy rather than matter, however as soon as it forms, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary black hole.

## We hope you enjoy the new releases!
