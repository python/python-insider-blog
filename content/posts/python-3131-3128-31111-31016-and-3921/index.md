Another big release day! Python 3.13.1 and 3.12.8 were regularly scheduled releases, but they do contain a few security fixes. That makes it a nice time to release the security-fix-only versions too, so everything is as secure as we can make it.

Python 3.13’s first maintenance release. My child is all growed up now, I guess! Almost 400 bugfixes, build improvements and documentation changes went in since 3.13.0, making this the very best Python release to date.

# Python 3.12.8

Python 3.12 might be slowly reaching middle age, but still received over 250 bugfixes, build improvements and documentation changes since 3.12.7.

I know it’s probably hard to hear, but this is the *second* security-only release of Python 3.11. Yes, really! Oh yes, I know, I know, but it’s true! Only 11 commits went in since 3.11.10.

Python 3.10 received a total of 14 commits since 3.10.15. Why more than 3.11? Because it needed a little bit of extra attention to keep working with current GitHub practices, I guess.

Python 3.9 isn’t quite ready for pasture yet, as it’s set to receive security fixes for at least another 10 months. Very similarly to 3.10, it received 14 commits since 3.9.20.

As always, upgrading is highly recommended to all users of affected versions.
