A small release day today! That is to say the releases are relatively small; the day itself was of average size, as most days are.

# Python 3.13.2

Python 3.13’s second maintenance release. About 250 changes went into this update, and can be yours for free if you just upgrade now.

# Python 3.12.9

Python 3.12’s *ninth* maintenance release already. Just 180 changes for 3.12, but it’s still worth upgrading.
