Alpha 2? But Alpha 1 only just came out!

[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3140a2/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3140a2/)

**This is an early developer preview of Python 3.14**

# Major new features of the 3.14 series, compared to 3.13

Python 3.14 is still in development. This release, 3.14.0a2 is the second of seven planned alpha releases.

Alpha releases are intended to make it easier to test the current state of new features and bug fixes and to test the release process.

During the alpha phase, features may be added up until the start of the beta phase (2025-05-06) and, if necessary, may be modified or deleted up until the release candidate phase (2025-07-22). Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and its use is **not** recommended for production environments.

Many new features for Python 3.14 are still being planned and written. Among the new major new features and changes so far:

-   [PEP 649](https://peps.python.org/pep-0649/): [deferred evaluation of annotations](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#pep-649-deferred-evaluation-of-annotations)
-   [PEP 741](https://peps.python.org/pep-0741/): Python configuration C API
-   [PEP 761](https://peps.python.org/pep-0761/): Python 3.14 and onwards no longer provides PGP signatures for release artifacts. Instead, Sigstore is recommended for verifiers.
-   [Improved error messages](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#improved-error-messages)
-   (Hey, **fellow core developer,** if a feature you find important is missing from this list, let Hugo know.)

The next pre-release of Python 3.14 will be 3.14.0a3, currently scheduled for 2024-12-17.
