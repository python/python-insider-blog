**This is an early developer preview of Python 3.15**

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3150a1/

# Major new features of the 3.15 series, compared to 3.14

Python 3.15 is still in development. This release, 3.15.0a1, is the first of seven planned alpha releases.

Alpha releases are intended to make it easier to test the current state of new features and bug fixes and to test the release process.

During the alpha phase, features may be added up until the start of the beta phase (2026-05-05) and, if necessary, may be modified or deleted up until the release candidate phase (2026-07-28). Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and its use is **not** recommended for production environments.

Many new features for Python 3.15 are still being planned and written. Among the new major new features and changes so far:

-   [PEP 799](https://docs.python.org/3.15/whatsnew/3.15.html#whatsnew315-sampling-profiler): A dedicated profiling package for Python profiling tools
-   [PEP 686](https://docs.python.org/3.15/whatsnew/3.15.html#whatsnew315-utf8-default): Python now uses UTF-8 as the default encoding
-   [PEP 782](https://docs.python.org/3.15/whatsnew/3.15.html#whatsnew315-pep782): A new `PyBytesWriter` C API to create a Python bytes object
-   [Improved error messages](https://docs.python.org/3.15/whatsnew/3.15.html#improved-error-messages)
-   (Hey, **fellow core developer,** if a feature you find important is missing from this list, let Hugo know.)

The next pre-release of Python 3.15 will be 3.15.0a2, currently scheduled for 2025-11-18.

# And now for something completely different

> And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting.
