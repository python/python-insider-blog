Python 3.3.7rc1 is now available, the release candidate of Python 3.3.7. It is a security-fix source-only release. Python 3.3.0 was released 5 years ago on 2012-09-29 and has been in security-fix-only mode since 2014-03-08. Per project policy, **all support for the 3.3 series of releases ends on 2017-09-29**, five years after the initial release. Therefore, Python 3.3.7 is expected to be the final release of any kind for the 3.3 series. After 2017-09-29, **we will no longer accept bug reports nor provide fixes of any kind for Python 3.3.x;** of course, third-party distributors of Python 3.3.x may choose to offer their own extended support. Because 3.3.x has long been in security-fix mode, 3.3.7 may no longer build correctly on all current operating system releases and some tests may fail. If you are still using Python 3.3.x, we **strongly** encourage you to upgrade to a more recent, fully supported version of Python 3; see [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are still using your own build of Python 3.3.x, please report any critical issues with 3.3.7rc1 to the Python bug tracker prior to 2017-09-18, the expected release date for Python 3.3.7 final. Even better, use the time to upgrade to Python 3.6.x! Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the success of Python 3.3.x over the past years!
