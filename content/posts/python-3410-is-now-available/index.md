Python 3.4.10 is now available. [You can download it here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3410/) Python 3.4.10 is the final release in the Python 3.4 series. As of this release, the 3.4 branch has been retired, no further changes to 3.4 will be accepted, and no new releases will be made. This is standard Python policy; Python releases get five years of support and are then retired. If you're still using Python 3.4, you should consider upgrading to the [current version--3.7.2 as of this writing.](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/) Newer versions of Python have many new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes, which should all serve to enhance your Python programming experience. We in the Python core development community thank you for your interest in 3.4, and we wish you all the best!
