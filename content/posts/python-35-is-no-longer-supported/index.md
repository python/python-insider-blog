Python 3.5 is no longer supported. There will be no more bug fixes or security patches for the 3.5 series, and [Python 3.5.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3510/) is the last release. The Python core development community recommends that all remaining Python 3.5 users should upgrade to the latest version.
