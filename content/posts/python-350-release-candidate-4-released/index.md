Python 3.5.0rc4 is now [available for download.](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350rc4/) This is a last-minute bugfix release before 3.5.0 final, to fix [a major regression](http://bugs.python.org/issue25027) found during the testing of Python 3.5.0rc3. This is a preview release, and its use is not recommended for production settings. However, as the final scheduled "release candidate", it should be virtually identical to the final release. Python 3.5.0 final is scheduled for release in less than a week, on September 13 2015.
