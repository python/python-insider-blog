There were no new changes in version 3.5.9; 3.5.9 was released only because of a CDN caching problem, which resulted in some users downloading a prerelease version of the 3.5.8 .xz source tarball. Apart from the version number, 3.5.9 is identical to the proper 3.5.8 release. [You can download Python 3.5.9 here.](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-359/)
