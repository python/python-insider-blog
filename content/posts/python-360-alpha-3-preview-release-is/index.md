[Python 3.6.0a3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360a3/) has been released. 3.6.0a3 is the third of four planned alpha pre-releases of Python 3.6, the next major release of Python. During the alpha phase, Python 3.6 remains under heavy development: additional features will be added and existing features may be modified or deleted. Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for production environments. Python 3.6.0 is planned to be released by the end of 2016. The next alpha, 3.6.0a4, is planned for 2016-08-15.
