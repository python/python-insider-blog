[Python 3.6.0a4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360a4/) has been released. 3.6.0a4 is the last of four planned alpha pre-releases of Python 3.6, the next major release of Python. During the alpha phase, Python 3.6 remains under heavy development: additional features will be added and existing features may be modified or deleted. Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for production environments. Python 3.6.0 is planned to be released by the end of 2016. The first beta pre-release, 3.6.0b1, is planned for 2016-09-12.
