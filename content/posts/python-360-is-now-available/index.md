Python 3.6.0 is now available! Python 3.6.0 is the newest major release of the Python language, and it contains many new features and optimizations. See [the What’s New In Python 3.6 document](https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/3.6.html) for more information. You can download Python 3.6.0 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/). Also, most third-party distributors of Python should be making 3.6.0 packages available soon.  
Maintenance releases for the 3.6 series will follow at regular intervals starting in the first quarter of 2017.  
We hope you enjoy Python 3.6.0! P.S. As a volunteer-staffed open source project, we could not bring Python releases to you without the enormous contributions of many, many people. Thank you to all who have contributed and reviewed code and documentation changes, documented and investigated bugs, tested Python and third-party packages, and provided and supported the infrastructure needed to support Python development and testing. Please consider supporting the work of [the Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/).
