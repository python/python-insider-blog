to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare their projects to  
support the new feature release. We strongly encourage maintainers of  
third-party Python projects to test with 3.6 during the beta phase and  
report issues found to [bugs.python.org](http://bugs.python.org/) as soon as possible. While the  
release is feature complete entering the beta phase, it is possible that  
features may be modified or, in rare cases, deleted up until the start  
of the release candidate phase (2016-12-05). Our goal is have no changes  
after rc1. To achieve that, it will be extremely important to get as  
much exposure for 3.6 as possible during the beta phase. Please keep in  
mind that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for  
production environments The next planned release of Python 3.6 will be 3.6.0b3, currently  
scheduled for 2016-10-31. More information about the release schedule  
can be found here: [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0494/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0494/)
