Python 3.6.1 is now available. Python 3.6.1 is the first maintenance release of Python 3.6, which was initially released in 2016-12 to great interest. Three months later, we are providing the first set of bugfixes and documentation updates to 3.6. See [the What’s New In Python 3.6 document](https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/3.6.html) for more information about features included in the 3.6 series. You can download Python 3.6.1 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-361/). The next maintenance release is expected to follow in about 3 months, before the end of 2017-06.
