Python 3.6.1rc1 is now available. Python 3.6.1rc1 is the release candidate for the first maintenance release of Python 3.6, which was initially released in 2016-12 to great interest. Three months later, we are providing the first set of bugfixes and documentation updates to 3.6. See [the What’s New In Python 3.6 document](https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/3.6.html) for more information about features included in the 3.6 series. You can download Python 3.6.1rc1 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-361rc1/). 3.6.1 is planned for final release on 2017-03-20 with the next maintenance release expected to follow in about 3 months.
