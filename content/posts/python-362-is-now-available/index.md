Python 3.6.2 is now available. Python 3.6.2 is the second maintenance release of Python 3.6, which was initially released in 2016-12 to great interest. With the release of 3.6.2, we are now providing the second set of bugfixes and documentation updates to 3.6. Detailed information about the changes made in 3.6.2 can be found in its [change log](https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-6-2). See [the What’s New In Python 3.6 document](https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/3.6.html) for more information about features included in the 3.6 series.
