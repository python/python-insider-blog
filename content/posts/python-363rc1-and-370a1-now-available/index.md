The Python build factories have been busy the last several weeks preparing  
our fall lineup of releases. Today we are happy to announce three  
additions: **3.6.3rc1**, **3.7.0a1**, and **3.3.7 final**, which join last weekend's  
**[2.7.14](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2714/)** and last month's **[3.5.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-354/)** bug-fix releases and **[3.4.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-347/)** security-fix  
update ([see all downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)). 1. Python [**3.6.3rc1**](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363rc1/) is the first release candidate for Python 3.6.3, the next  
maintenance release of Python 3.6. While 3.6.3rc1 is a preview release and,  
thus, not intended for production environments, we encourage you to explore  
it and provide feedback via the Python bug tracker (https://bugs.python.org).  
3.6.3 is planned for final release on 2017-10-02 with the next maintenance  
release expected to follow in about 3 months. You can find Python 3.6.3rc1  
and more information here:  
[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363rc1/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363rc1/) 2. Python **[3.7.0a1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370a1/)** is the first of four planned alpha releases of Python 3.7,  
the next feature release of Python. During the alpha phase, Python 3.7  
remains under heavy development: additional features will be added  
and existing features may be modified or deleted. Please keep in mind  
that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for  
production environments. The next preview release, 3.7.0a2, is planned  
for 2017-10-16. You can find Python 3.7.0a1 and more information here:  
[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370a1/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370a1/) 3. Python **[3.3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-337/)** is also now available. It is a security-fix source-only release  
and is expected to be the final release of any kind for Python 3.3.x before it  
reaches end-of-life status on 2017-09-29, five years after its initial release.  
Because 3.3.x has long been in security-fix mode, 3.3.7 may no longer build  
correctly on all current operating system releases and some tests may fail.  
If you are still using Python 3.3.x, we **strongly** encourage you to **upgrade**  
**now to a more recent, fully supported version** of Python 3. You can find  
Python 3.3.7 here:
