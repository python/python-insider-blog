1\. Python [**3.6.4rc1**](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364rc1/) is the first release candidate for Python 3.6.4, the next  
maintenance release of Python 3.6. While 3.6.4rc1 is a preview release and,  
thus, not intended for production environments, we encourage you to explore  
it and provide feedback via the Python bug tracker ([https://bugs.python.org](https://bugs.python.org/)).  
3.6.4 is planned for final release on 2017-12-18 with the next maintenance  
release expected to follow in about 3 months. You can find Python 3.6.4rc1  
and more information here:  
[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364rc1/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364rc1/) 2. Python **[3.7.0a3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370a3/)** is the third of four planned alpha releases of Python 3.7,  
the next feature release of Python. During the alpha phase, Python 3.7  
remains under heavy development: additional features will be added  
and existing features may be modified or deleted. Please keep in mind  
that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for  
production environments. The next preview release, 3.7.0a4, is planned  
for 2018-01-08. You can find Python 3.7.0a3 and more information here:
