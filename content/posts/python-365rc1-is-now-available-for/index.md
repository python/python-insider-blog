Python **[3.6.5rc1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365rc1/)** is the first release candidate for Python 3.6.5, the next maintenance release of Python 3.6. While 3.6.5rc1 is a preview release and, thus, not intended for production environments, we encourage you to explore it and provide feedback via the Python bug tracker ([https://bugs.python.org](https://bugs.python.org/)). **3.6.5** is planned for final release on 2018-03-26 with the next maintenance release expected to follow in about 3 months. You can find Python 3.6.5rc1 and more information here:  
[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365rc1/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365rc1/) **Attention macOS users**: as of 3.6.5rc1, there is a new additional installer variant for macOS 10.9+ that includes a built-in version of Tcl/Tk 8.6. This variant is expected to become the default variant in future releases. Check it out!
