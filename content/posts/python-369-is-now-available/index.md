Python **[3.6.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-369/)** is now available. 3.6.9 is the first security-only-fix release of **Python 3.6**. Python 3.6 has now entered the security fix phase of its life cycle. Only security-related issues are accepted and addressed during this phase. We plan to provide security fixes for Python 3.6 as needed through 2021, five years following its initial release. Security fix releases are produced periodically as needed and only provided in source code form; binary installers are not provided. We urge you to consider upgrading to the latest release of [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/), the current fully-supported version. You can find the release files, a link to the changelog, and more information here:
