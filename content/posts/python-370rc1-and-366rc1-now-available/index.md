Python **[3.7.0rc1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370rc1/)** and **[3.6.6rc1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366rc1/)** are now available. 3.7.0rc1 is the **final planned release preview** of **Python 3.7**, the next feature release of Python. 3.6.6rc1 is the **release preview** of the next maintenance release of **Python 3.6**, the current release of Python. Assuming no critical problems are found prior to **2018-06-27**, the **scheduled release dates for 3.7.0 and 3.6.6,** no code changes are planned between these release candidates and the final releases. These release candidates are intended to give you the opportunity to test the new features and bug fixes in 3.7.0 and 3.6.6 and to prepare your projects to support them. We strongly encourage you to test your projects and report issues found to [bugs.python.org](https://bugs.python.org/) as soon as possible. Please keep in mind that these are preview releases and, thus, their use is not recommended for production environments. *Attention macOS users*: there is now a new installer variant for macOS 10.9+ that includes a built-in version of Tcl/Tk 8.6. This variant will become the default version when 3.7.0 releases. Check it out! You can find these releases and more information here:
