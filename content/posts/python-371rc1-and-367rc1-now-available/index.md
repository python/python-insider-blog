Python **[3.7.1rc1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-371rc1/)** and **[3.6.7rc1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-367rc1/)** are now available. 3.7.1rc1 is the **release preview** of the first maintenance release of **Python 3.7**, the latest feature release of Python. 3.6.7rc1 is the **release preview** of the next maintenance release of **Python 3.6**, the previous feature release of Python. Assuming no critical problems are found prior to **2018-10-06**, no code changes are planned between these release candidates and the final releases. These release candidates are intended to give you the opportunity to test the new security and bug fixes in 3.7.1 and 3.6.7. We strongly encourage you to test your projects and report issues found to [bugs.python.org](https://bugs.python.org/) as soon as possible. Please keep in mind that these are preview releases and, thus, their use is not recommended for production environments. You can find these releases and more information here:
