Python **[3.7.4rc2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374rc2/) is** now available. 3.7.4rc2 is the second **release preview** of the next maintenance release of **Python 3.7**, the latest feature release of Python. Assuming no further critical problems are found prior to **2019-07-08**, no code changes are planned between this release candidate and the final release. The release candidate is intended to give you the opportunity to test the new security and bug fixes in 3.7.4. Because of the small number of changes between **rc1**, the original release preview, and **rc2**, we are planning on an **abbreviated exposure cycle** so we can get the final release to you as soon as possible. We strongly encourage you to test your projects and report issues found to [bugs.python.org](https://bugs.python.org/) as soon as possible. Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and, thus, is not recommended for production environments. You can find the release files, a link to the changelog, and more information here:
