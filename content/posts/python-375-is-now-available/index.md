Python [3.7.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-375/) is now available, the next maintenance release of Python 3.7. You can find the release files, a link to the changelog, and more information here: [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-375/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-375/) Note that the next feature release of Python 3, Python [3.8.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/), is also now available. Python 3.8 contains many new features and optimizations. You should consider upgrading to it. We plan to continue regular **bugfix releases** of Python 3.7.x through **mid-year 2020** and provide **security fixes** for it until **mid-year 2023**. More details are available in [PEP 537](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0537/), the Python 3.7 Release Schedule (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0537/). Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development and these releases possible! Please consider supporting our efforts by volunteering yourself or through organization contributions to the Python Software Foundation.
