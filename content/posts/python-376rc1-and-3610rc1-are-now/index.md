Python **[3.7.6rc1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-376rc1/)** and **[3.6.10rc1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3610rc1/)** are now available. 3.7.6rc1 is the **release preview** of the next maintenance release of **Python 3.7;** 3.6.10rc1 is the **release preview** of the next security-fix release of **Python 3.6**. Assuming no critical problems are found prior to **2019-12-18**, no code changes are planned between these release candidates and the final releases. These release candidates are intended to give you the opportunity to test the new security and bug fixes in 3.7.6 and security fixes in 3.6.10. While we strive to not introduce any incompatibilities in new maintenance and security releases, we encourage you to test your projects and report issues found to [bugs.python.org](https://bugs.python.org/) as soon as possible. Please keep in mind that these are preview releases and, thus, their use is not recommended for production environments. You can find the release files, a link to their changelogs, and more information here:
