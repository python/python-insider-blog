Python [3.7.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/), the next bugfix release of **Python 3.7**, is now available. You can find the release files, a link to the changelog, and more information here:  
[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/)  
Note that **Python 3.8** is now the latest feature release series of Python 3. You should consider upgrading to it. Get the latest release of 3.8.x [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). We plan to continue regular **bugfix releases** of Python 3.7.x through **mid-year 2020** and provide **security fixes** for it until **mid-year 2023**. More details are available in [PEP 537](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0537/), the Python 3.7 Release Schedule.  
Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development and these releases possible! Please consider supporting our efforts by volunteering yourself or through organization contributions to the Python Software Foundation.
