Python [3.7.7rc1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377rc1/), the release preview of the next maintenance release of **Python 3.7**, is now available for testing. Assuming no critical problems are found prior to **2020-02-10**, no code changes are planned between this release candidate and the final release. The release candidate is intended to give you the opportunity to test the new security and bug fixes in 3.7.7. While we strive to not introduce any incompatibilities in new maintenance releases, we encourage you to test your projects and report issues found to [bugs.python.org](https://bugs.python.org/) as soon as possible. Please keep in mind that, since this is a preview release, its use is not recommended for production environments. You can find the release files, a link to the changelog, and more information here:
