Python [3.7.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-378/), the next bugfix release of **Python 3.7**, is now available. You can find the release files, a link to the changelog, and more information here:  
[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-378/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-378/)  
Note that **Python 3.8** is now the latest feature release series of Python 3. After two years of quarterly 3.7.x bugfix releases and with the successful release and adoption of **Python 3.8** over the last year, **3.7.8** is expected to be **the last bugfix release** in the 3.7 series. You should consider upgrading to 3.8 as soon as practical. Get the latest release of 3.8.x [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Following our release support policy, after 3.7.8 we plan to provide **security fixes** for 3.7 as needed until **mid-year 2023**, five years after its initial release. More details are available in [PEP 537](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0537/), the Python 3.7 Release Schedule.  
In addition to 3.7.8, the lastest security fix rollup for **Python 3.6**, **3.6.11**, is also now available. You can download its source release here:
