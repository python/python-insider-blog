Python [3.7.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/) and [3.6.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3612/), the latest security fix rollups for **Python 3.7** and **Python 3.6**, are now available. You can find the release files including updated binary installers for 3.7.9, links to the changelogs, and more information here:  
[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/)  
[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3612/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3612/)  
Note that **Python 3.8** is now the latest feature release series of Python 3. You should consider upgrading to 3.8 as soon as practical. Get the latest release of 3.8.x [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Binary installers are normally not provided for **security fix** releases. However, since 3.7.8 was the last 3.7.x **bugfix** release and there are security fixes published in 3.7.9 that apply to users of some of the binary installers provided with 3.7.8, we have made an exception and are also updating the Windows and macOS binary installers for 3.7.9. We do not plan to provide further binary updates for future 3.7.x security releases.  
Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development and these releases possible! Please consider supporting our efforts by volunteering yourself or through organization contributions to the Python Software Foundation.
