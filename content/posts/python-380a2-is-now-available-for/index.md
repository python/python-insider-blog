[https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/changelog.html](https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/changelog.html) **Python 3.8.0a2** is the second of four planned alpha releases of **Python 3.8**, the next feature release of Python. During the alpha phase, **Python 3.8** remains under heavy development: additional features will be added and existing features may be modified or deleted. Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for production environments. The next preview release, **Python 3.8.0a3**, [is planned for](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0569/) 2019-03-25.
