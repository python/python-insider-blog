On behalf of the entire Python development community, and the currently serving Python release team in particular, I’m pleased to announce the release of two of the latest Python editions. **Python 3.8.2** Python 3.8.2 is the second maintenance release of Python 3.8 and contains two months worth of bug fixes. Detailed information about all changes made in 3.8.2 can be found in [its change log](https://docs.python.org/release/3.8.2/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-8-2-final). Note that compared to 3.8.1, version 3.8.2 also contains the changes introduced in 3.8.2rc1 and 3.8.2rc2. The Python 3.8 series is the newest feature release of the Python language, and it contains many new features and optimizations. You can find Python 3.8.2 here:  
[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/) See the “[What’s New in Python 3.8](https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html)” document for more information about features included in the 3.8 series. Maintenance releases for the 3.8 series will continue at regular bi-monthly intervals, with 3.8.3 planned for April 2020 (at the [PyCon US sprints](https://us.pycon.org/2020/events/sprints/)). **Python 3.9.0a4** An early developer preview of Python 3.9 is also ready:  
[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390a4/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390a4/) Python 3.9 is still in development. This releasee, 3.9.0a4 is the fourth of six planned alpha releases. Alpha releases are intended to make it easier to test the current state of new features and bug fixes and to test the release process. During the alpha phase, features may be added up until the start of the beta phase (2020-05-18) and, if necessary, may be modified or deleted up until the release candidate phase (2020-08-10). Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for production environments. **We hope you enjoy both!** Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development and these releases possible! Please consider supporting our efforts by volunteering yourself or through organization contributions to the Python Software Foundation.
