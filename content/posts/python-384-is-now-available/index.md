Python 3.8.4 is the fourth maintenance release of Python 3.8. Go get it here: [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-384/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-384/) Maintenance releases for the 3.8 series will continue at regular bi-monthly intervals, with **3.8.5** planned for mid-September 2020.

### What’s new?

The Python 3.8 series is the newest feature release of the Python language, and it contains many new features and optimizations. See the “[What’s New in Python 3.8](https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html)” document for more information about features included in the 3.8 series. This is the first bugfix release that is considerably smaller than the previous three. There’s almost 20% fewer changes at 162 commits than the average of previous three bugfix releases. Detailed information about all changes made in version 3.8.4 specifically can be found in [its change log](https://docs.python.org/release/3.8.4/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-8-4-final). Note that compared to 3.8.3, version 3.8.4 also contains the changes introduced in 3.8.4rc1.
