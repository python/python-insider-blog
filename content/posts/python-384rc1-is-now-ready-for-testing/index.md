Python 3.8.4rc1 is the release candidate of the fourth maintenance release of Python 3.8. Go get it here:  
[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-384rc1/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-384rc1/) Assuming no critical problems are found prior to **2020-07-13**, the scheduled release date for **3.8.4**, no code changes are planned between this release candidate and the final release.  
That being said, please keep in mind that this is a pre-release and as such its main purpose is testing.  
Maintenance releases for the 3.8 series will continue at regular bi-monthly intervals, with **3.8.5** planned for mid-September 2020.

### What’s new?

The Python 3.8 series is the newest feature release of the Python language, and it contains many new features and optimizations. See the “[What’s New in Python 3.8](https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html)” document for more information about features included in the 3.8 series. This is the first bugfix release that is considerably smaller than the previous three. There’s 20% less changes at 130 commits than the average of previous three releases. Detailed information about all changes made in version 3.8.4 specifically can be found in [its change log](https://docs.python.org/release/3.8.4rc1/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-8-4-release-candidate-1).
