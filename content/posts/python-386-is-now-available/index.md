Python 3.8.6 is the sixth maintenance release of Python 3.8. Go get it here:

[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-386/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-386/)

Maintenance releases for the 3.8 series will continue at regular bi-monthly intervals, with **3.8.7** planned for mid-November 2020.

### What’s new?

The Python 3.8 series is the newest feature release of the Python language, and it contains many new features and optimizations. See the “[What’s New in Python 3.8](https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html)” document for more information about features included in the 3.8 series.

Python 3.8 is becoming more stable. Our bugfix releases are becoming smaller as we progress. This one contains 122 changes, less than two thirds of the previous average for a new release. Detailed information about all changes made in version 3.8.6 specifically can be found in [its change log](https://docs.python.org/release/3.8.6/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-8-6). Note that compared to 3.8.5 this release also contains all changes present in 3.8.6rc1.

### We hope you enjoy Python 3.8!
