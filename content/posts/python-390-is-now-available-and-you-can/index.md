On behalf of the Python development community and the Python 3.9 release team, I’m pleased to announce **the availability of Python 3.9.0**.

Python 3.9.0 is the newest feature release of the Python language, and it contains many new features and optimizations. You can find Python 3.9.0 here:

[https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

Most third-party distributors of Python should be making 3.9.0 packages available soon.

See the “[What’s New in Python 3.9](https://docs.python.org/release/3.9.0/whatsnew/3.9.html)” document for more information about features included in the 3.9 series. Detailed information about all changes made in 3.9.0 can be found in its [change log](https://docs.python.org/release/3.9.0/whatsnew/changelog.html#changelog).

Maintenance releases for the 3.9 series will follow at regular bi-monthly intervals starting in late November of 2020.

### OK, boring! Where is Python 4?

Not so fast! The next release after 3.9 will be 3.10. It will be an incremental improvement over 3.9, just as 3.9 was over 3.8, and so on.

In fact, our newest Release Manager, Pablo Galindo Salgado, prepared the first alpha release of what will become 3.10.0 a year from now. You can check it out here:

### We hope you enjoy the new releases!

Thanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development and these releases possible! Please consider supporting our efforts by volunteering yourself or through organization contributions to the Python Software Foundation.
