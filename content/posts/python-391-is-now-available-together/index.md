It’s starting to get very cold (at least on the Northern hemisphere) so we have been carefully packaging a total of three new Python releases to keep you warm these days!

# Python 3.9.1

Python 3.9.1 is the first maintenance release of Python 3.9, and also the first version of Python to support macOS 11 Big Sur natively on Apple Silicon. Go get it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-391/).

Maintenance releases for the 3.9 series will continue at regular bi-monthly intervals, with 3.9.2 planned for Monday, 2021-02-08.

# Python 3.10.0a3

Python 3.10a3 is the third alpha release of Python 3.10. You can get it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100a3/):

# Python 3.8.7rc1

Python 3.8.7rc1 is the release preview of the next maintenance release of Python 3.8. You can get it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-387rc1/).

Assuming no critical problems are found prior to 2020-12-21 , the currently scheduled release date for 3.8.7 , no code changes are planned between this release candidate and the final release. That being said, please keep in mind that this is a pre-release of 3.8.7 and as such its main purpose is testing.

# And now for something completely different

In mathematics, a [Borwein integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borwein_integral) is an integral whose unusual properties were first presented by mathematicians David Borwein and Jonathan Borwein in 2001. These integrals are remarkable for exhibiting apparent patterns that eventually break down. The following is an example:

This pattern continues up to

At the next step the obvious pattern fails,
