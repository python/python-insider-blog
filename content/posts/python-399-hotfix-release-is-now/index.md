*Python 3.9.9* is the eighth maintenance release of the legacy 3.9 series. *Python 3.10* is now the latest feature release series of Python 3. [Get the latest release of 3.10.x here](https://python.org/downloads/).

3.9.9 was released out of schedule as a **hotfix** for an `argparse` regression in Python 3.9.8 which caused complex command-line tools to fail recognizing sub-commands properly. Details in [BPO-45235](https://bugs.python.org/issue45235). There are only three other bugfixes in this release compared to 3.9.8. See the [changelog](https://docs.python.org/release/3.9.9/whatsnew/changelog.html) for details on what changed.

Upgrading to 3.9.9 is highly recommended if you’re running Python 3.9.8.

The next Python 3.9 maintenance release will be 3.9.10, currently scheduled for 2022-01-03.

## We apologize for the inconvenience

…and still hope you’ll enjoy the new release!
