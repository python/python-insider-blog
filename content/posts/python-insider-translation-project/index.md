We think the content of this blog is useful for the whole Python community, so reaching as many people as we can is one of our priorities. To expand our reach, we have assembled a team of translators to create parallel editions of the blog in other languages. We are launching two translations today: [Japanese](http://blog-ja.python.org/) and [Spanish](http://blog-es.python.org/).

The translations will lag a little behind the posts on [Python Insider](http://blog.python.org/), but try to keep more or less up to date.

#### Help Wanted

The translation team is still very small, so we are looking for more people to join. We need people able to work on the existing languages, or to help us expand to other languages. If you can help in either way, contact Doug Hellmann (doug dot hellmann at gmail).
