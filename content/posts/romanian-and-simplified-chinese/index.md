The Python Insider team is very excited to announce two new blogs today. Translators for [Romanian](http://blog-ro.python.org) and [Simplified Chinese](http://blog-cn.python.org) have joined the [Translation Project](http://blog.python.org/2011/05/python-insider-translation-project.html), and have already started publishing the backlog of posts. As with the other translations, these parallel editions may lag slightly behind the original posts on [Python Insider](http://blog.python.org/).
